# HAPI Typescript/Javascript Bindings

This is an Experimental Project exploring the possiblities of producing
a low level binding package for the Hedera API Protobuf that can aid in
authoring other TS/JS projects interacting with the HAPI.

Creators make no assertion of future maintanance or support.  We suggest
you do not use this package at this time.
