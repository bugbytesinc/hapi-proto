## [@bugbytes/hapi-mirror](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bugbytes/hapi-mirror)  

This package provides a helper client for retrieving data from an Hedera Mirror Node.  
The data structures exposed by this library are generated from the Hedera Mirror Nodeâ€™s 
OpenAPI data structure with the help of the 
[openapi-typescript]( https://github.com/drwpow/openapi-typescript#readme) project.  
This package depends on both the ` @bugbytes/hapi-proto` and `@bugbytes/hapi-util` as 
well as an implementation of the **Fetch API** to intrinsically exist in the process environment.
